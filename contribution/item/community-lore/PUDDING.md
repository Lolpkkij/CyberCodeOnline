At night i was walking around until suddenly i saw a pudding in a snow
I rub my eye in disbelief and taste it...
The taste was unimaginable and the temperature was perfect....but 
After Christmas it was never found again,i was about give it to someone else
And i wonder again why it disappears when i give it to someone else.
